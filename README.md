# Book Recommendation Project

The project aims at creating a book recommendation system based on three approaches:
- Simple Solutions: suggesting the most popular content in the same genre to the readers. 
- Content-based filtering, recommending books based on the attributes of the books themselves. 
- Collaborative filtering, recommending books based on the assumption that users will like products that are consumed by other users with similar taste.

## Data
Book Genome Dataset: The dataset contains 9,374 books, 6,815,898 tag genome scores and 5,152,656 user ratings associated with these books. The original dataset can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/book-genome/).
